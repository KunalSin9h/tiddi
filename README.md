## Setup Locally

> If you want to run the server inside a docker container, you can follow these [instructions](https://github.com/kunalsin9h/tiddi/blob/main/Docker.md)

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (latest version recommended)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) (latest version recommended)

### Steps

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalsin9h/tiddi.git
```

2. Change the working directory

```bash
cd tiddi
```

4. Run the server

```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```

7. Open http://localhost:5656 in your browser

## Environment Variables

You can set the following environment variables to change the default settings of the server.

| Environment Variable | Default Value       | Description                       |
| :------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------------- |
| `PORT`               | `5656`              | Port on which the server will run |
| `DB`                 | `./database/dev.db` | Path to the database file         |
| `HOST`               | `localhost`         | Host on which the server will run |

#### Example

```bash
export PORT=8080
export DB=./database/prod.db
export HOST=https://tiddi.kunalsin9h.com

go run cmd/main.go
```

or alternative way is set the environment while running the server

```bash
PORT=8080 DB=./database/prod.db HOST=https://tiddi.kunalsin9h.com go run dmd/main.go
```

> The `HOST` environment variable is used to generate the `unique image id` of the image, it is recommended to set it to the domain name of the server. `HOST` is also used in the sample frontend to fetch the image from the server.
